## Technical details
# Architecture
This app has been developed using an MVVM architectural pattern, which is a combination of the Model-View-ViewModel architecture. In this implementation, the binding between the Views and the ViewModels is done via delegation. The app has three major layers:

The ViewController, which contains the views and other UIKit-related units.
The Model, which contains the model of application.
The ViewModel, which contains the networking and local data handling, as well as the models and authentication logic needed to connect to the Marvel API.
